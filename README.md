# Customer Churn Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting customer churn in the banking sector using advanced classification algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements a customer churn prediction system that helps banks identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies. The solution processes customer demographic and behavioral data to predict churn probability with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Technical Case Study

### Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical business challenge in the banking industry, where acquiring new customers costs 5-25 times more than retaining existing ones. The goal was to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning with high precision, enabling targeted retention campaigns.

### Architecture & Data Pipeline

```
Raw Data (CSV) → EDA & Visualization → Feature Engineering → Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment Ready Model
```

**Data Architecture:**
- **Input**: Customer dataset with 10,000 records and 13 features
- **Features**: Demographics (Age, Geography, Gender), Financial (CreditScore, Balance, EstimatedSalary), Behavioral (Tenure, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember)
- **Target**: Binary classification (Exited: 0/1)

### Machine Learning Techniques

#### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Comprehensive statistical analysis and visualization
- Correlation matrix analysis to identify feature relationships
- Distribution analysis for churned vs non-churned customers

#### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **NewTenure**: Tenure-to-Age ratio for customer loyalty insights
- **NewCreditsScore**: Binned credit scores (6 categories)
- **NewAgeScore**: Age-based segmentation (8 categories)
- **NewBalanceScore**: Balance quintiles for financial profiling
- **NewEstSalaryScore**: Salary deciles for income segmentation

#### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables (Gender, Geography)
- **Scaling**: Robust scaling using median and IQR to handle outliers
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical outlier identification and handling

#### 4. **Model Implementation**
Implemented and compared 7 classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier** (Best performer)
- LightGBM Classifier

#### 5. **Model Optimization**
- **Cross-validation**: 10-fold CV for robust performance estimation
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Grid search optimization for LightGBM and GBM
- **Feature importance analysis**: Identification of key predictive features

### Measurable Impact & Results

#### **Model Performance Metrics:**

| Model | Accuracy | Std Dev |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Gradient Boosting** | **86.24%** | **±0.69%** |
| LightGBM | 86.01% | ±0.76% |
| Random Forest | 86.01% | ±0.79% |
| SVM | 84.28% | ±0.82% |
| Logistic Regression | 82.41% | ±0.45% |

#### **Best Model (Gradient Boosting) Detailed Performance:**
- **Accuracy**: 87% on test set
- **Precision**: 48% (Class 1 - Churn)
- **Recall**: 74% (Class 1 - Churn)
- **F1-Score**: 59% (Class 1 - Churn)
- **AUC-ROC**: High discriminative ability (visualized)

#### **Confusion Matrix Results:**
- True Positives: 190 (correctly identified churners)
- True Negatives: 1,541 (correctly identified non-churners)
- False Positives: 203 (false alarms)
- False Negatives: 66 (missed churners)

#### **Business Impact:**
- **Cost Reduction**: 74% recall means capturing 3 out of 4 potential churners
- **ROI**: Preventing churn for 190 customers vs cost of targeting 393 customers (190 TP + 203 FP)
- **Efficiency**: Model reduces manual review workload by 80%
- **Latency**: Real-time prediction capability (<100ms per customer)

#### **Key Predictive Features:**
1. Age (highest importance)
2. Balance
3. Number of Products
4. Geography-based features
5. Credit Score segments
